### **SKELETON & SURFACE**

>The remaining features and content kept in make up the **minimal viable product** at this time. The **MVP** *(minimal viable product)* consists of the [Home](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/index.html-wireframe.pdf) page, [About](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/about.html-wireframe.pdf), [Gallery](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/gallery.html-wireframe.pdf) & [Get In Touch](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/get-in-touch.html-wireframe.pdf) pages respectively.

**Colour Scheme & Background**
> The pictures used for the project were of natural landscapes with high ratios of green, blue, white, and brown colouring. Therefore, the stylistic choice was to use off white/grey colouring with opacity for the footer element. The Header was a solid grey colour to block content scrolling under as the user move the page up. The colour scheme along with subtle, thin borders around content elements gave a natural feel to the site overall.
>
>   *Navigation background colour*
> * Hex  (#cfcccc)
>
>  *Footer background colours:*
> * rgba(185, 185, 185, 0.5)
>  
>  *Content background colour:*
> * rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5 - 0.7)

**Buttons & Links**

>To aid usability links and buttons followed the same style. Notably changing from black to white when hovered over. This is a sharp contrast and a nod to New Zealand Sports and Culture as white and black have long been the colour scheme for the country in many regards.
