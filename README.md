-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue red, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

# **The Cup Game**
# INTRODUCTION
---
>The website is focused on the game of “shells”, in this case cups. The site is minimal and elegant, while allowing for a high degree of user interaction and customization. The Cup Game is simple and challenging providing the user with an all round positive experience.

>python3 -m http.server

# UX

### **STRATEGY, SCOPE & STRUCTURE**

**The Cup Game:**
>Three identical cups are displayed side-by-side in a line; the ball is shown to be under one of the cups. The cups are then shuffled randomly over a period not exceeding 5 seconds. The player then clicks the cup they think the ball is under. If they guess right, they have won that game of cups and progress

**Creator Goals:** 
> * I want users to have an enjoyable experience playing the cup game. It should be easy to understand but challenging to beat.
> * The user interaction should be slick and customizable to keep gamers coming back.
> * This is an observation game not a memory game, so the difficulty will be changeable to give all users a fun experience.

**Games Target User:** 
> * People of all ages.
> * Users interested in an observation-based game.
> * People with any device type (mobile-first design).

**New User:** 
> * As a new user, I want to quickly understand the core game concepts, so I can enjoy playing sooner. 
> * As a new user, I want a fun and interactive experience regardless of the device I am playing on.
> * As a new user, I want to be able to change the difficulty of the game, so I can have an experience tailored for me.

**Returning User:** 
> * As a returning user, I want my score to be saved, so I can compete and beat my PB’s.
> * As a returning user, I want to be able to make suggestions, to better improve the experience.
> * As a returning user, I want to be able to customise the game in some way, to make it more appealing to my tastes.

**User Pathway:** 
> * The single paged website will cache/load cosmetic changes and game results to better engage users, personalising the experience by differentiating between new and returning users.
>

**Game Logic**
>
>* A basic breakdown of how the game of cups will function. This is to help with JavaScript Implementation of the game.

>![Image](docs/images/wireframes/game-logic.png)

**Project Content** 
> *Page Content :*
> * Main Title
> * Game Area
> * Cup Colour Picker
> * Social Media Links
> * Contact Us Form

> *Game Content :*
> * Start Game Button

### **SKELETON & SURFACE**

**Wireframes - New User**
>*Moblie + Tablet*
>
>![Image](docs/images/wireframes/tablet-moblie-newuser.png)
>
> * As a new user the how to play button is already toggled on, this is to aid in usability. This site layout is consistent for all device sizes. The game is centralised to draw focus, and will be contrasted against the background. 

>*Desktop*
>
>![Image](docs/images/wireframes/desktop-newuser.png)
>
> * Using the desktop space to focus on the game, leaving plenty of room to draw the eye.

**Wireframes - Return User**
>*Moblie + Tablet*
>
>![Image](docs/images/wireframes/tablet-moblie-retuser.png)
>
> * For returning users, the how to play button is toggled off. In its place is a previous score display, and their last selected cup colour is set to current colour. 

> *Desktop*
>
>![Image](docs/images/wireframes/desktop-retuser.png)
>
> * Following the style and content formatting of the smaller devices, with the expection of the off center "previous score" display and colour picker.

**Colour Scheme**
> Static site colours:
>
>The site has two standard colours, #e5e5e5 for the body background and #333 for the font, labels, and buttons text colour. Both are intentional dull to complement the third colour which is customisable by the user. 
>
>Customisable colour scheme: 
> 
>With the use of the **colour picker**, the user can change the colour of the cup elements displayed on the site, as well as the colour of the footer’s *social links*, 'contact us' *button* and 'contact us' form *header background*. 

**Buttons & Links**

>**Instruction and start button :** 
>Both have cursor: pointer when hovered over, letting the user know an event will happen when clicked. For the Instruction button a drop down div will display game information. With a click on the start button the game will initialise. 

>**Difficulty settings buttons :**
>The easy, medium, and hard buttons are toggle elements that share the same name. Only one button can be selected at a time. The selected button becomes black to make it easy for the user to know what difficulty they are playing on.

>**Footer Buttons :**
>All footer buttons have cursor: pointer when hovered over, letting the user know an event will happen when clicked. The Contact us button will launch a modal for submitting feedback about the game. The social links open pages to the respective sites.
